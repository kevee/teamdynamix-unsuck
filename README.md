# TeamDynamix Usability

A Chrome Extension to improve the overall usability of TeamDynamix. There's a lot to love about TDx, but several interactions and interfaces are lackluster. Most notable of these is all the popup windows it creates when managing tickets.

## What it fixes

_Note:_ the extension **does not** do anything to the administrator interface.

- [x] (Tries to) prevent popup windows from appearing when clicking a link or button
- [ ] Tracks history in the browser's native URL so you can copy-paste to things like tickets, etc.
- [ ] Makes search actually search for things
- [ ] Reorder the ticket view so important details are on top

## How to install

I haven't published this to the Chrome Store yet, so until then:

- Use the **Clone or download** button above to download the file.
- Unarchive the file.
- Go to `chrome://extensions`.
- Toggle the **Developer mode** toggle above.
- Click **Load unpacked** and select the _folder_ `teamdynamix-usability` you just unzipped.
